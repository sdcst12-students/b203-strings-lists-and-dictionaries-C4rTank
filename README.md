## SDSS Computing Studies Python Assignment


Objectives:
* Retrieve and store data from multi value variables
* Understand the difference between a tuple and a list
* Create and use dictionary (dict) type variables
* Explore how the "for" command can be used to iterate through a tuple, dict or list

tuples, lists and dicts are multi value variables.  There is no set number of values that they may store.

Lists:

Tuples:

Dictionaries:

The examples will show you how you can declare variables of these types and how you can add or retrieve their values.

### XX Tasks

##### Task 1
sort all of the values of x into 2 lists.
1 list should contain all of the float values and the other list should contain all the integer values
(2 points) 

##### Task 2
use a for loop to iterate through all possible integers to find the factors of 24
(2 points)

##### Task 3
Use a for loop inside a for loop to generate every possible combination of card rank and suit and store them into the deck list
(3 points)

##### Task 4
repeat task3, but use the following strings to help you generate your list
remember, we can also access the members of a string using the same index methods that are used to access lists and tuples
(2 points)

##### Task 5
write a python script to use all of the integers from 1-10 as the keys and the squares of those numbers as the values
(2 points)

##### Task 6
Write a python script display the values of the dictionary that are sorted by their keys (ascending values)
(3 points)
