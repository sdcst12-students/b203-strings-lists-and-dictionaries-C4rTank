## SDSS Computing Studies Python Assignment


Objectives:
* Retrieve and store data from multi value variables
* Understand the difference between a tuple and a list
* Create and use dictionary (dict) type variables
* Explore how the "for" command can be used to iterate through a tuple, dict or list
